I have found that in order to truly succeed at something, you have to love doing it. 

You don't have to always be happy, in fact you almost certainly won't be. It's not the instant gratification type of love, which yields a shallow level of commitment, riding on the same wave as a person's emotions. It's the kind that is able to push through **hours of blunders, or days of hair-pulling frustrations** and come out the other side stronger for it.

And it turns out, the things you love find you.
